# UI Development Guidelines

## Before Completing UI Changes

When making ANY changes to the user interface:

1. **Always remind the user** to:
   - Run the appropriate MCP server to test the changes
   - Take a screenshot to verify the UI renders correctly
   - Check that all interactive elements work as expected

2. **Verification Checklist**:
   - Layout renders correctly
   - Responsive design works on different screen sizes
   - No console errors
   - All buttons/links are functional
   - Styling matches design requirements

3. **After Changes**:
   - Ask the user to confirm the UI looks correct
   - Request feedback on any issues
   - Offer to make adjustments if needed

## Important Notes

- Never assume UI changes work without user verification
- Always provide clear testing instructions
- Be proactive about asking for visual confirmation
